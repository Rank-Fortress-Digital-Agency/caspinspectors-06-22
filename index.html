                    The majority of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) claims relate to an inability to provide accessible parking spaces and proper slopes. When a business or local government restripes parking spaces within a parking lot, parking garage, or other parking facilities, it must provide accessible parking space to people with disabilities as required by the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards). Businesses that cater to the general public with goods and services are obligated under the ADA guidelines to remove barriers that prevent access to the disabled in existing parking facilities. Restriping is an affordable exercise that often results in achieving the minimum accessible space required for ADA compliance. State and local governments are also responsible on an ongoing basis to provide van-accessible ADA parking spaces in their parking garages.

                        <p>
                            New Parking Lot construction projects must meet minimum standards with very few exceptions; alterations are also subject to strict requirements, although they may be more affected by existing structural conditions. Existing buildings and facilities which are not undergoing planned alterations are viewed a little differently.

                        <p>
                            Accessible spaces must connect to the shortest accessible route to the accessible building entrance or facility they serve. If a parking facility serves multiple buildings or accessible entrances, accessible parking spaces should be dispersed to enable people to park near as many accessible entrances as possible.

                        <p>
                            Accessible parking spaces must be identified by signs that include the International Symbol of Accessibility. Signs at van-accessible spaces must include the additional phrase “van-accessible.” Signs should be mounted so that the lower edge of the sign is at least five (5) feet above the ground. This helps ensure visibility both for motorists and local enforcement officials.

                        <p>
                            Accessible parking spaces, aisles, and routes must be maintained in good repair and kept clear of snow, ice, or fallen leaf build-up. The ADA establishes these requirements to ensure that when parking facilities are provided by entities covered by Title II or Title III, accessible spaces with certain features are available. Many state and local governments have their own requirements, which may be more specific or more stringent.

                            ADA PARKING LOT COMPLIANCE
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            You must ensure the accessibility of your store, offices, and buildings, and this includes providing accessible spaces in your parking garage and other parking areas. Customers can get to the parking spot. It’s from the availability of ADA spaces in a parking lot to the right signage where ADA compliance is enforced by various laws and regulations. Here are a few general rules for avoiding an ADA lawsuit concerning ADA parking. Many businesses open to the public are required to provide a van-accessible ADA parking space for every 25 parking spaces. Some types of hospitals and medical services require a higher number. It’s important to note that while trying to achieve accessible spaces in an existing parking lot, the shortest route from van-accessible parking to accessible entrances must be considered. Also, one out of six ADA parking spaces must be van accessible. If your organization has difficulty understanding the ADA parking requirements, contact our LA certified access specialist.
